# GameCraft
This is a repository of 2D games, the first of which I made in 2018 
because I wanted a break from studying SICP. They represent a (partial)
run through the [first steps to game development guide](https://www.gamedev.net/articles/programming/general-and-gameplay-programming/your-first-step-to-game-development-starts-here-r2976).

Note that the 'architecture' of the games improved significantly once
I got my head around how to structure them better. I haven't gone back 
and reworked the early games into better shape. This means that, as is
usually the case, *any game except the latest is terrible* :)

(I **would** like to rework the early games into better shape, but I would like to work through the full 'first steps' guide first. But there's an infinite number of other things I can do as well, and only a finite number of hours in the year.)

I got some ideas re. code structure from [here](http://github.com/Mekire/cabbages-and-kings) while making the Missile Command clone.

PongyPong, WormyWorm, BreakyBreakout and MissilyMissileCommand are all games made in Python3 using PyGame. To run them, simply ensure Python3 and PyGame (for Python3) are both installed, and then simply run the main .py file - e.g. MissilyMissileCommand.py.
